# Algorithms Path Visualizer
This web app visualizes the paths traversed by different path finding algorithms.<br>

### Algorithms 
- Dijkstra
- Astar
- Depth First Search
- Breath First Search
- Greedy 

### Key Points
- Takes care of no solution case
- Start and End nodes can be changed 
- Walls can be built on the grid which blocks the paths from the start to end
