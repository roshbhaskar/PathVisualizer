# Algorithms Path Visualizer
This web app visualizes the paths traversed by different path finding algorithms.<br>

### Algorithms 
- Depth First Search
- Breath First Search
- A Star Search
- Greedy Search


### Key Points
- Takes care of no solution case
- Start and End nodes can be changed 
- Walls can be built on the grid which blocks the paths from the start to end
- Calculates the total distance between the start and end nodes
